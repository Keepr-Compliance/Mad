# Module: Dependency Graph

## Required outputs

1) **Mermaid graph** (human-readable)
2) **YAML edges list** (machine-readable)

## Node types

- `task`: Backlog items (e.g., TASK-101)
- `integration`: Integration checkpoints (e.g., int/phase1-core)
- `milestone`: Sprint milestones

## Edge types

- `depends_on`: Task B cannot start until Task A completes
- `conflicts_with`: Tasks touch same code; cannot run in parallel
- `merge_group`: Tasks that merge together (hierarchical integration)

## Rules

- If `conflicts_with` edges exist inside the same phase, you must:
  - Resequence tasks
  - OR create integration branches and define merge order

## Mermaid output format

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Phase1[Phase 1: Foundation]
        TASK101[TASK-101: Types]
        TASK102[TASK-102: API]
    end

    subgraph Phase2[Phase 2: Features]
        TASK103[TASK-103: UI]
    end

    TASK101 --> TASK102
    TASK102 --> TASK103

    TASK101 -.conflicts_with.-> TASK102
```

## YAML output format

```yaml
dependency_graph:
  nodes:
    - id: TASK-101
      type: task
      phase: 1
      title: "Type definitions"
    - id: TASK-102
      type: task
      phase: 1
      title: "API layer"
    - id: int/phase1
      type: integration
      phase: 1

  edges:
    - from: TASK-101
      to: TASK-102
      type: depends_on
      reason: "API needs types"
    - from: TASK-101
      to: TASK-102
      type: conflicts_with
      reason: "Both touch shared-types/"
```

## File-Overlap Matrix (Required Before Parallel Approval)

Before approving any tasks for parallel execution within a phase, produce a
file-overlap matrix listing every file modified by more than one task.

### Template

```markdown
### Shared File Analysis

| File | Modified By | Conflict Type |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| src/path/to/file.tsx | TASK-XXX, TASK-YYY | semantic / textual / none |

**Recommendation:** Sequential / Parallel with owner constraints / Safe parallel
```

### Rules

- If any file appears in more than one task's modification list, classify the
  overlap as **semantic** (same component, different concerns), **textual**
  (likely merge conflict), or **none** (different exports in same file).
- Semantic or textual overlap **defaults to sequential execution** unless SR
  Engineer explicitly approves parallel with file-ownership constraints.
- When parallel execution is approved despite overlap, each task plan
  (in `pm_backlog_items.body`) must populate its "File Boundaries" section
  with owned and restricted files.
- If no files overlap across tasks in a phase, state "No shared files -- safe
  for parallel execution" and skip the matrix.

> **Incident ref:** BACKLOG-883/889 -- semantic conflict in `SettingsManager.tsx`.
> See `.claude/plans/investigations/parallel-shared-file-conflict-analysis.md`.

## Validation rules

- No circular dependencies
- All tasks have at least one edge (isolated tasks are suspicious)
- Integration nodes must have inbound edges from all phase tasks
- Conflicts must be resolved with sequencing or integration branches
