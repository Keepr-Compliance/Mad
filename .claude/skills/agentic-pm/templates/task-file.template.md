# Task TASK-XXX: <Title>

---

## WORKFLOW REQUIREMENT

**This task MUST be implemented via the `engineer` agent.**

Direct implementation is PROHIBITED. The correct workflow is:

1. PM writes this task plan to `pm_backlog_items.body` for the backlog item
2. PM invokes `engineer` agent with `subagent_type="engineer"`
3. Engineer agent implements, tracks metrics, creates PR
4. PM invokes `senior-engineer-pr-lead` agent for PR review
5. SR Engineer approves PR
6. **Engineer merges PR and verifies merge state is MERGED**
7. Task marked complete only AFTER merge verified (`pm_update_task_status` + `pm_update_item_status` to `completed`)

**CRITICAL:** Creating a PR is step 3 of 7, not the final step. Task is NOT complete until PR is MERGED.

**PR Lifecycle Reference:** `.claude/docs/shared/pr-lifecycle.md`

If you are reading this task plan and about to implement it yourself, **STOP**.
Use the Task tool to spawn the engineer agent instead.

## Goal

<Clear, concise statement of what this task accomplishes. 1-2 sentences.>

## Non-Goals

<Explicitly list what this task does NOT do. Prevents scope creep.>

- Do NOT <thing 1>
- Do NOT <thing 2>
- Do NOT <thing 3>

## Deliverables

<List of files to create or modify>

1. New file: `<path/to/file.ts>`
2. Update: `<path/to/existing.ts>`

## File Boundaries

> **Purpose:** Prevents semantic conflicts when tasks run in parallel. If this task
> runs sequentially (no parallel peers), this section can be marked "N/A -- sequential execution."

### Files to modify (owned by this task):

- `<path/to/file1.ts>`
- `<path/to/file2.tsx>`

### Files this task must NOT modify:

- `<path/to/shared-component.tsx>` -- Owned by TASK-XXX in this sprint
- `<path/to/types.ts>` -- Frozen; changes require sequential resequencing

### If you need to modify a restricted file:

**STOP** and notify PM. The task may need to be resequenced.

## Acceptance Criteria

<Checkboxes that must ALL be true for the task to be complete>

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3
- [ ] No modifications to files outside the "Files to modify" list (parallel tasks only)
- [ ] All CI checks pass

## PM Estimate (PM-Owned)

**Category:** `<schema | service | ipc | ui | refactor | test | config | docs>`

**Estimated Tokens:** ~XK-YK

**Token Cap:** XK (4x upper estimate)

> If you reach this cap, STOP and report to PM. See `.claude/docs/shared/token-cap-workflow.md`.

**Estimation Assumptions:**

| Factor | Assumption | Impact |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Files to create | X new files | +XK |
| Files to modify | X files (scope: small/medium/large) | +XK |
| Code volume | ~X lines | +XK |
| Test complexity | Low/Medium/High | +XK |

**Confidence:** Low / Medium / High

**Risk factors:**
- <uncertainty 1>
- <uncertainty 2>

**Similar past tasks:** <TASK-XXX (actual: XK tokens) if applicable>

## Implementation Summary (Engineer-Owned)

**REQUIRED: Record your agent_id immediately when the Task tool returns.**

*Completed: <DATE>*

### Agent ID

**Record this immediately when Task tool returns:**
```
Engineer Agent ID: <agent_id from Task tool output>
```

### Checklist

```
Files created:
- [ ] <file 1>
- [ ] <file 2>

Features implemented:
- [ ] <feature 1>
- [ ] <feature 2>

Verification:
- [ ] npm run type-check passes
- [ ] npm run lint passes
- [ ] npm test passes (if applicable)
```

### Metrics (Auto-Captured)

**From SubagentStop hook** - Run: `grep "<agent_id>" .claude/metrics/tokens.csv`

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Tokens** | X |
| Duration | X seconds |
| API Calls | X |
| Input Tokens | X |
| Output Tokens | X |
| Cache Read | X |
| Cache Create | X |

**Variance:** PM Est ~XK vs Actual ~XK (X% over/under)

### Notes

<REQUIRED: Document the following>

**Planning notes:**
<Key decisions from planning phase, revisions if any>

**Deviations from plan:**
<If you deviated from the approved plan, explain what and why. Use "DEVIATION:" prefix.>
<If no deviations, write "None">

**Design decisions:**
<Document any design decisions you made and the reasoning>

**Issues encountered:**
<Document any issues or challenges and how you resolved them>

**Reviewer notes:**
<Anything the reviewer should pay attention to>

### Estimate vs Actual Analysis

**REQUIRED: Compare PM token estimate to actual to improve future predictions.**

| Metric | PM Estimate | Actual | Variance |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Tokens** | ~XK | ~XK | +/-X% |
| Duration | - | X sec | - |

**Root cause of variance:**
<1-2 sentence explanation of why estimate was off, e.g., "Complex type debugging", "Clean implementation with existing patterns">

**Suggestion for similar tasks:**
<What should PM estimate differently next time? e.g., "This category should use 0.5x multiplier">
